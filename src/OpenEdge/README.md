#OpenEdge.Net.pl Overrides#

**Updates: July 22th, 2019**

Merged code changes from 12.0 which primarily included modifications to the Logging classes.

**Updates: October 12th, 2018**

This folder contains code from the forthcoming SP4 (11.7.4) and is considered pre-release code.
However, it should be the code that is bound to ship for that release. All files contained within
consist of differences from 11.7.3, thus the minimum version supported by this release of the
Progress Spark Toolkit will be 11.7.3 and should be reflected in any supporting documents.
